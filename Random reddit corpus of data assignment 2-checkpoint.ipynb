I was 19 at the time of all this and have been on non speaking terms with my dad since 18 really. I lived at home with my mom and had been going through a lot of medical problems myself since I was 17, which also caused some personal emotional issues with the following events.\\r  \\n\\r  \\nI think it was February 15th or so, sometime early in the month. My mom and I were going to the hospital for a doctor's visit for my condition. We got in there and we ended up taking her to the ER instead because she was in so much pain. We stayed there for the entire evening and that's when they told us she had a huge tumor in her esophagus. We went home, she went to bed and I stayed up and cried all night looking at the prognosis of esophageal cancer. The next day we went to another doctor and then a few more visits and weeks later, it was confirmed. She had stage 4 esophageal cancer. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nMy mom wasn't the person to look at the odds and let it be something to deter her. She fought it as hard as she could, but after an upper endoscopy with the doctor pulling me aside and saying the prognosis was, “3 months max”, my hope was dwindling fast. We went to her oncologist who drew up a plan of radiation and chemo for the next few months and we started immediately. The oncologist had said she had at least a few years left, which restored some of my hope, but I've come to realize it was only false hope. The radiation went really well and ended up shrinking the masses that had spread by a large percentage, but she was still having trouble eating and getting around, so she got a walker. I'll never forget going to the medical store to shop for walkers and she just wanted a pretty one. She got the pink one and we went to Olive Garden. Probably the last time I went to dinner with my mom. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nA few days later she started chemo, which didn't go as well as we’d hoped. After her first treatment her blood count was too low to get another dose and we waited another week. By that weekend, she had been in a lot of pain and she went into the hospital. She stayed there probably 3 weeks in total, if even. I drove 30 minutes to the hospital every morning as early as they'd let me in and I’d stay till the last minute allowed. Every day. I made sure to spend every minute I could with her. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nAfter a few days or a week she went to get a mri or some type of scan and they had administered some type of medication to help her relax. Except that as soon as they had put the shot in her IV, she had passed out. The nurses started rushing around a bit and called for narcan, but she ended up coming to on her own. Ever since then she had been kinda slurred in speech and never fully came back. She would sleep more and more and eventually got to the point of texting me and family friends nonsense. All the while every day I would ask what was going on? When would that wear off? When would she be back to normal? And now I understand the uncomfortable shifts in the nurses and saying the doctor would be in. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nIt sounds dumb, I know, how could I not see it coming or understand that them asking if I had, “any other family”, or, “anyone else”, meant maybe it wasn't as alright as they made it out to be. I feel like an idiot because I was there every fucking day and my sister and I only knew she was dying 2 days before she did. It makes me mad because why didn't they just tell me her organs were failing for the past 2 weeks? \\r  \\n\\r  \\nThere was a palliative care doctor that came to talk to my sister and I before our mom was too far gone. She had said we needed to convince our mom to sign a DNR and that she should forgo dialysis and pass peacefully. I struggle everyday with this conversation and having gone back into my moms hospital room to tell her if she went on dialysis, it wouldn't get better. If she didn't sign the dnr they would perform cpr and break her ribs and the like. Originally she still wanted to fight, “whatever needs to happen, I’ll do it”, but her heartbreaking, “oh”, after being told that dialysis wouldn't make it better and that we as her kids would then have to decide when to stop the care is what breaks me everytime. She wanted to fight, she didn't know she was dying, and I had to convince her to stop fighting. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nShe passed away a day later with me and my sister by her side. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nThere were some other things that happened that I struggle with, but I’m not sure how many people this age go through it. When someone is dying, regardless of them having a large mass in their esophagus or not, they can't eat or drink for the last day or two. At least that's what it was like for her. She had been struggling to eat the whole time, but in the last week or so she barely ate. On her last day, she was able to mutter that she was thirsty. As she can't swallow anything at this point, you have to wet a small sponge attached to a toothbrush and tell them to open their mouths and you can wipe the inside of their mouths so it isn't dry. After a while, a family friend offered to bring us sandwiches as my sister and I had been there all day without eating. We got them and my sister ate, but my mom started trying to talk and all she could get out was that she wanted to eat. I couldn't eat for the next 2 days and still lose my appetite thinking about that. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nI’m just curious if anyone out there was around that age and/or has similar experiences and would be willing to explain your emotional journey afterwards. It’s been about two years now and I feel like I've been in this catatonic state of dulling my emotions and just trying to not feel sad, angry, and depressed about all this. I’ve been looking for a therapist in the network and am finally ready to sit with someone and talk about it, but I figured this might be an easier way to open up first. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nPlease remember to be present with the people you love and to tell them how much they mean to you before you can't, they may be gone sooner than you think. Tell them you love them, tell them everything you wish they knew or think they already know because one day you’ll wish you had. \\r  \\n\\r  \\nThanks for any responses or even just reading my story\",\n",
