       " \"Christianity has historically picked and chosen what they want to believe. Most so called Christians have never read the Bible, don't understand it, and decide that their way is better.\\n\\nThis is nothing new. Even the ancient Israelites failed to adhere to those laws.\\n\\nToday, this is inexcusable given how accessible the Bible is thanks to the internet.\\n\\nFurthermore, most Christians have come up with dogma, theology, and beliefs and try to use the Bible to justify their beliefs instead of the other way around. I took the approach of not accepting any teaching until I've read the entire Bible myself then tried to figure out who is closest to what I've read.\",\n",
       " \"Because, fundamentally, homosexuality as a concept is extremely recent. By which I mean a romantic and sexual relationship between two consenting adults of the same sex.\\n\\nThe situations where same-sex acts would be carried out, in both the Old and New Testaments, were really not the kind of relationship that homosexuals today ask to be recognized and accepted. For instance, homosexual relations in the Roman empire would often take the form of a dominant man raping a submissive man, or of male prostitution, or of an older man having a pedophilic master-student relationship with a male teenager.\\n\\nAt the same time, the traditional justification for homosexual acts being sinful was not *only* because of these situations in which they would be expected to happen. Both Jewish and Christian tradition interpreted it to be a sin for a man to purposefully sow his seed where it cannot impregnate a woman, using notably the example of Onan, the son of Judah, who in Genesis was stuck dead for doing this so as not to fulfill his duty of levirate marriage (making it a mortal sin). Also, marriage was understood to be strictly between a man and a woman for ritual reasons (the man representing Jesus and the woman representing the Church), and of course sex outside of marriage is illegitimate, so that rules out homosexual acts too.\\n\\nBut it's not like these things (the context in which homosexuality was practiced, and the nature of the act itself) were thought of separately by anyone. It is only recently that they have been thought of separately—turns out you don't need to be a rapist, a pedophile or a prostitute to be homosexual after all.\\n\\nSo the division within Christianity today is because of this. Does one prioritize the sinfulness of homosexuality due to *the context* (so that it's not a sin today if it's within a monogamous, consensual, pious marriage)? Or does one prioritize the sinfulness of homosexuality due to *the act* (so that it's a sin and always will be)? \\n\\nP.S.: For those who don't know, the vast, vast majority of churches teach it is a sin primarily because of the act. I see a lot of Muslims say that Christianity as a whole allows gay marriage today, so this may need to be clarified.\\n\\nAlso, concerning capital punishment for homosexuality in the Law... This is understood to mean it is a mortal sin. The result of a mortal sin is not actually execution but excommunication until one repents (although execution was how excommunication was done in the old covenant, if the Sanhedrin had the necessary proof and the guilty party was indeed utterly unrepentant; in the new covenant, excommunication bars one from receiving communion for a certain time, although often just confessing one's sin is seen as penance enough unless one did something criminal).\",\n",

       " \"**FYI:**  \\nThe purpose of the “LGBT Pride” movement is to promote pride, homosexual relations, transgenderism, equality of the sexes, cross-dressing and the effeminate man.  \\n1. God finds pride to be an abomination.  \\nProverbs 16:5 – “Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.”  \\nProverbs 16:18 – “Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.”  \\n2. God finds homosexual relations to be an abomination.  \\nLeviticus 18:22 – “Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.”  \\nLeviticus 20:13 – “If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.”  \\n1 Corinthians 6:9-10 – “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.”  \\nRomans 1:26-27 – “For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature: And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.”  \\n3. God created us as male and female, this is an objective truth dictated by our very DNA and not based upon our feelings.  \\nMark 10:6 – “But from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female.”  \\n4. God did not create man and woman equal; each have their respective strengths and weakness and He has set out a clear hierarchy (although I find it important to stress that He values both man and woman equally).  \\n1 Corinthians 11:3 – “But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.”  \\n5. God finds a man or woman who dresses in the garments of the opposite sex to be an abomination.  \\nDeuteronomy 22:5 – “The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.”  \\n6. God states that the effeminate man will not inherit the kingdom of God.  \\n1 Corinthians 6:9-10 “Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.”\",\n",

But that rather means a revival of the wickedness of the empire before it was Christianized (together with the wickedness of the Babylonian, Medo-Persian and Greek empires as well, as Revelation shows the kingdom of Antichrist as a summary of all four), especially since the empire has been gone for centuries now and the final emperor did not turn out to be Antichrist nor did Antichrist immediately show up (however it is true that many nations have been trying since to resume the legacy of the Roman empire and to be recognized as its proper replacement).',\n",

       " \"See [Daniel 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+2&version=NKJV), where King Nebuchadnezzar has a dream which Daniel correctly interprets: there stands a statue with a head of gold, a chest and arms of silver, a belly and thighs of brass, and legs and feet of iron and clay. Then a stone cut out of nowhere appears, topples over the statue and becomes a mountain that covers the whole world. Daniel interprets the head of gold to be the Babylonian empire, then the part of silver, the part of brass and the part of iron & clay to be three kingdoms that succeed it, then the rock that turns into a mountain to be the Kingdom of God.\\n\\nThe academic interpretation is that these are the Babylonian, Median, Persian and Greek empires, with the author living at the time of the Maccabean revolt and expecting it to culminate with the appearance of the Kingdom of God. The traditional Christian interpretation is that these are either the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek and Roman empires, or, in the Syriac tradition, that these are the Babylonian, Median, Persian and Greco-Roman empires. This creates a difference of interpretation for the rest of the book as well since the interpretation that the last empire is the Roman one usually makes the great final enemy prophesied by Daniel (like in Daniel 7) to be the Antichrist or some Roman precursor such as Nero, while the latter interpretation makes it to be Antiochus IV Epiphanes (something the academic interpretation agrees with as well).\\n\\nBut in any case, the Roman empire, as the culmination of every evil empire that persecuted God's people, gets toppled over by the stone that is cut out without hands—that is, Jesus Christ Who is a new creation made from Mary's flesh—and the stone becomes a great mountain that covers the whole world—the Kingdom of God, the messianic kingdom, the Church, which now is spreading slowly but at the second coming will become universally known.\\n\\nBut, obviously, the Roman empire did not actually cease to be until the 15th century. However, Jesus already speaks in the Gospels of His kingdom as something unlike the kingdoms of this world. So the Church is not a nation like the US or France or Russia, but a nation that transcends all nations, transforms and conquers them from within, not changing policies but rather changing people's hearts to lead them to knowledge of the one true God and away from idols. And of course it has only one King, Jesus. The conversion of the Roman empire as well as of Ethiopia, Armenia and Georgia, all within the 4th century, shows in what way the Church topples over worldly nations.\\n\\nI can point to St. Irenaeus of Lyons, St. Hyppolitus of Rome, the Apostolic Constitutions, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Gregory of Nyssa, St. Jerome of Stridon, St. Cyril of Jerusalem, St. Gregory of Rome and St. Aphrahat the Persian as teaching this doctrine.\",\n",

We arrogantly think we know better than God, that our morals and sense of justice are much higher and that He should never have told us to kill and eat meat. Self-righteousness made Job’s suffering long and painful and finally God had to step in and tell him and his friends the reason for all the suffering.

       " \"\\nHell is NOT what most churches and religions say it is. While the word hell appears in the bible and Jesus spoke of it, the true meaning what hell is has been obscured by Greek philosophy and doctrines based on those philosophies.\\n\\nThe word “hell” is an archaic English rendition of the Hebrew word (sheol) and the Greek word (hades) that appear in the earliest bible writings we have today. These words rendered into modern language would read, “the grave or under the ground” (sheol), “the place or location of the dead” (hades). Nothing about a place of eternal punishment.\\n\\nThe word “hell” itself was derived from the Latin “inferna” which is defined as: “of or relating to a nether world or place of the dead, hell”. It has no relation to the English word “inferno”.\\n\\nHell is not an English word per se. The word Hel/Hell comes from Germanic and Norse languages which crept into the English lexicon.\\n\\nJesus and the apostles taught the death is like sleep followed by a resurrection (See John 11:11-15). The early church leaders – Clement, Ignatius, Hermas, Polycarp, and others who believed that death is a sleep followed by a resurrection, taught that the resurrected deliberate and unrepentant wicked are destroyed forever as if being totally consumed in a fire – their punishment was to be annihilation. These leaders did not teach of an immortal soul to be tortured by fire for eternity.\\n\\nBy the middle of the 2nd Century some church “leaders” such as Athenagorus and Tertullian began to incorporate Greek philosophies into bible teachings. This confused bible teachings with non-biblical philosophies.\\n\\nIt was Athenagorus (133-190 AD), a professed Christian and a church leader but whose teachings, according to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, were heavily influenced by Plato's philosophies, who introduced Plato's teaching (circa 400 BC) of an immortal soul into Christianity. In doing so he opened the way for the adoption of Plato’s argument of eternal punishment for immortal sinful souls. This was a hundred years after the apostle's and came straight from Greek philosophy. There are no such teachings in the bible.\\n\\nHell is the grave, nothing else.\\n\\nEcclesiastes 9:5 NKJB\\n\\n>5 For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing,\\nAnd they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten.\\n\\nEcclesiastes 9:10 New King James Bible\\n\\n>10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.\\n\\nJohn 5:28–29 NKJB\\n\\n>8 Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice 29 and come forth...\\n\\nRevelation 20:14-15 King James Version\\n\\n>14 Then death and hell were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.\\n15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire.\\n\\nThese verses are very problematic for hellfire believers and teachers. Death and Hell are inanimate things which cannot be tortured by fire or anything else. If hell and the lake of fire are the same thing, how can “hell” be thrown into itself??\\n\\nNow if one has an immortal soul they are alive. Their name should then be in the book of life. But the lake of fire is only for those who's names are not in the book of life. That creates a paradox.\\n\\nThere are those who still may insist hell is a place of eternal torture by fire. This SLANDERS God as being an evil and vindictive being who would torture people for eternity for doing something that they cannot prevent doing (See Romans 5:12). The bible states the “wages of sin is death”, not eternal punishment in fire (See Romans 6:23).\\n\\nVisit https://JW.org\",\n",
       " 'He created humanity to have a loving relationship with us. And while he wants everyone to be believers, that is just not going to happen. So why does he create people who are going to hell anyway? I think it’s probably because they still have purpose in this world. Sounds confusing but even if they don’t believe, God still can use their life for the good of his kingdom. So many believers in existence and in existence to come would not have even been born if not for their non believing ancestors. See what I am saying?\\n\\nWhile we can’t understand fully why God does what he does, we can still see that these non believers still have purpose in this world even if they choose not to follow God. This does not mean God is manipulating them or anything, but He does have an overall plan for the world and his kingdom',\n",
       " 'The only way to conclude that the Bible teaches never-ending punishment in hell is to read it completely out of context. Paul taught that Christ died for our sins, that He was buried (*He*\\xa0was buried — not just His body, while He went elsewhere — which means He ceased to exist as a conscious being), and that He rose again the third day (meaning He was resurrected from the dead in a physical body). Because of this, sin has now been dealt with for every human — past, present, and future — and so every human will eventually experience the type of salvation that Paul primarily wrote about (which means to be resurrected if dead, and to be made immortal, and hence sinless; it has nothing to do with avoiding never-ending suffering in a place called hell, which isn’t what most people think it is at all), although each in their own order: first the members of the body of Christ, then later the resurrected members of the Israel of God, 75 days after Jesus returns to the earth, and finally everyone else, at the end of the ages. And if God has given you the faith to believe that Christ died for our sins, that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day, and the understanding of what this actually means (because one can’t truly believe something they don’t actually understand), then it means you’ve been elected by God to join the body of Christ, and you’ll be one of the first to enjoy salvation. But even if God hasn’t chosen to give someone faith (and if He hasn’t, they *can’t* believe this anyway), the Bible promises us that everyone will still eventually experience salvation, so you can be reconciled to God (be at peace with God in your mind) because God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself (which means He’s now at peace with each of us), not imputing their trespasses unto them.\\n\\nIf you’d like to learn the scriptural references for what I wrote above, please check out this in-depth study on the topic (nobody has ever been able to refute the scriptural interpretations laid out in this article, and I can guarantee that nobody will here either): [What the Bible really says about heaven, hell, judgement, death, and salvation](https://www.concordantgospel.com/bible)',\n",

I would like to say first that all Bible-reading Christians wrestle with what they decide to be more reliable or not even if they don\\'t want to admit it. After all, there are many contradictions and contrasting opinions found throughout the Bible. Even if you wanted to be a Biblical Literalist/Text-based fundamentalist and wanted to believe in \"Biblical creation,\" which Biblical creation myth are you going to decide to believe? The Genesis 1 version? The Genesis 2 version? Maybe even Psalm 74:12-14, which I have heard scholars call a creation story. \\n\\nThat being said, I put the utmost focus as a Christian on Christ and Gospels, as they are the center of the Christian faith. Even with that, however, there could potentially be biases in even these accounts. I put the greatest authority on the words and stories around Christ, especially if these accounts are repeated between Gospels. As such, though there is still plenty of divine wisdom and inspiration to be gleaned from Old Testament, the annals of the kings are of far lesser concern. \\n\\nI also try my best to understand any of the Biblical texts in their historical, cultural, and religious contexts. For example, much of the earliest written parts of the Old Testament aren\\'t even monotheistic but henotheistic (see Psalm 82:1 and Deutronomy 32:8-9). Though a notable and fascinating transition that can be seen through the texts, I rarely hear it spoken of when Christians try to understand early Hebrew  Bible passages. Adapting to how the author had interpreted the world around them helps provide a better idea to what they meant than just applying modern ideas onto the text. \\n\\nI\\'d also like to note that the Bible is not my sole source of divine knowledge in my faith. I tend to view it in regards to the Wesleyan Quadrilateral: scripture, experience, reason, and tradition. Each of these informs my faith and how I view God each day. As such, between my experiences, reason, tradition, the example set by Christ in the Gospels, God is a good loving god. And as a good loving god, he asks us to love our neighbors as ourselves. I do not believe this same God would ask his servants to slaughter their neighbors, especially innocent children and other non-combatants. Kings, though, will always look for reasons to justify their atrocities; and back in the day, invoking the divine was just the way to go. You have to think too that if you accept that God would order genocide, would you dare look over all the genocides that have occurred in the last 200 years and try to figure out which ones God might have commanded?

Societies that adopt monogamous marriage have larger more peaceful populations because children have a stable home with a mother and father. More men marry and have kids than in polygamous cultures, so they have incentive for a more peaceful future. What use to society is the marriage of two men or two women. They are less likely to have kids to pass on culture to. If they do have kids those kids will have a less than optimal upbringing because they won\\'t have a father and mother. Statistically, a two parent homosexuality home is better than a single mother home, but no better than a single father home. An additional issue is that domestic abuse rates are higher in homosexual relationships, so they may have an additional negative impact on culture when allowed to be normalized.

A finite created spirit must have the structure of, precisely, the finite, the created, and spirit. It must have an actual absolute past in nonbeing and an absolute future in the divine infinity, and the continuous successive ordering of its existence out of the former and into the latter is what it is to be a spiritual creature. \\n\\nEvery spiritual creature as spirit is a pure act of rational and free intentionality away from the utter poverty of nonbeing and toward infinite union with God. This \\'temporal\\' or \\'diastematic\\' structure is no less intrinsic to it than is its dynamic synthesis of essence and existence, or of stability and change.

But, he loved us too much to let that be the end of it.  He would come to the earth from heaven, become one of us, and then die for us.
